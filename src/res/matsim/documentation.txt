Notes on matlab SIR simulation

The matlab script make_setup.m simulates TB measurements of an SSM/I 
fly-over a synthetic image.  It calls sim_SIR.c which creates SIR and
gridded images products from the measurements.  The simulation and
processing are highly simplified in order to illustrate the process.

Note that the synthetic image is low-pass filtered to meet the Nyquist
sampling requirements for SIR reconstruction.

Theory for the SIR algorithm is given in
