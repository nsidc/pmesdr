Refer to scrontab-l.txt file to see the scrontab that runs daily on CURC
systems. This job pulls the latest code from the github repo and compiles and
then runs nosetests and regression tests.

There is also a quick regression test that can be run at any time for quick
testing. The workflow for the regression assumes that you have a conda env named
${PMESDR_CONDAENV}. The conda env needs nose, numpy and netCDF4.
