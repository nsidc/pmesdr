scrontab-l.txt
	this file shows the scrontab that runs pulls the latest
	code from the github repo and compiles and then runs
	nosetests and regression tests at midnight on Alpine
	supercomputer.  There is also a quick regression test
	that can be run at any time for quick testing
	The workflow for the regression assumes that you have a
	conda env and in this scrontab that is set to cetb3
	The conda env needs nose and numpy and netCDF4
