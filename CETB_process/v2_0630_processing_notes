There are new scripts in CETB_process/scripts
   l1c_to_gsx.sh - processes input swath files for v2
   combine_amsr.sh - combines AMSR2 .nc.partial files into a single AMSR2 GSX input file suitable for processing
   run_gsx_loadbalance.sh - use to sbatch the gsx conversions
   run_make_loadbalance.sh - runs the list of make files
   run_setup_year_loadbalance.sh - to run a year of setup files
   run_sir_year_loadbalance.sh - to run a year of sir files
   run_setup_rm_year_loadbalance.sh  - to delete a year of setup files

The l1c_to_gsx.sh script will handle SSMI, SSMIS and AMSR2 conversions into GSX format - it is similar to the previous nc_to_gsx.sh and hdf_to_gsx.sh, but with extra arguments

It takes 4 arguments and will then create an output file with a list of files to be converted from input swath format into GSX format.  Note that for AMSR2 and AMSRE there is an extra step required AFTER the conversions and that is to combine the GSX input files - this runs from a separate script

Arguments for l1c_to_gsx.sh
gsx_type - one of SSMIS-L1C, AMSR2-L1C, SSMI-L1C, AMSR2-JAXA, AMSRE-L1C or AMSRE-JAXA
src - F16, F08 (or all of the other DMSP satellites), for AMSR2 or AMSRE same as gsx_type
suffix - the input file suffix eg RT-H5 for L1C files, h5 for JAXA files
top_level - same as before - the top level directory under /scratch/alpine/$USER

Arguments for combine_amsr.sh
src - either AMSR2 or AMSRE
top_level - same as before
