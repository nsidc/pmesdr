1.  Transfer all of the input files to summit
2.  Take note of the start doy, end doy, total doys, total number of input files
    	 Copy the requisite shell scripts from /projects/moha2290/CETB_process/scripts
3.  Run nc_to_gsx.sh to create script to convert input to gsx - arguments SSMIS-CSU and source (F18 e.g.)
4.  Verify contents of generated file with head, tail and wc -l (should have same number of lines as files)
5.  use sbatch run_gsx.sh Fxx to create gsx files files and verfiy file count in xxx_GSX directory
6.  run daily_file_lists.sh to create list of input files for each day in series - these are stored in xxx_lists
    	arguments are year, start_doy, end_doy, platform i.e. yyy ddd ddd Fxx
7.  run file_3day.sh to create list of input files for NS projections for each day in series
    	arguments are yyyy ddd ddd Fxx
8.  count to confirm the correct number of files created
9.  use grep to check for no "such" messages in files created - should ony be in NS files for first and last doys -
    this is useful because it will also show if there are missing days of files
10. use sed to edit files to remove missing file messages
    	grep -l such ../Fxx_lists/* | xargs sed -i '/such/d'
11. run SSMIS_make.sh to create lists for make process
12. combine all make files by "catting" them into a files called Fxx_make_list
13. count number of lines in input file to run_make
14. run_make.sh, takes 1 argument F18 or whichever platform - to generate make files for setup process - files are stored in xxx_make
15. from this point processing should proceed by year
16. execute SSMIS_setup_year.sh with arguments of 4-digit year and platform to generate list of commands for loadbalancer
17. sbatch run_setup_year.sh with arguments of yyyy Fxx to run 1 year
18. after completion, execute SSMIS_sir_year.sh to create list of sir commands for loadbalancer
19. sbatch run_sir_year.sh with yy and Fxx as arguments (note 2 digit year)
20. execute SSMIS_setup_rm_year.sh with yy Fxx arguments to create list of setup files to remove
21. sbatch run_setup_rm_year.sh yy Fxx, with dependency as follows:-
    	   sbatch --dependency=afterok:{jobid_from_sir} run_setup_rm_year.sh yy Fxx
22. at this point I usually edit the list of sir commands using sed to create the lists for further years
23. also edit the list of setup rm commands with sed to change year
24. Now you can proceed to chain setup, sir and setup_rm jobs with dependencies.
25. Note that 1 year of SSMIS setup files is around 15 - 17 TB, so plan accordingly.

Once the processing has completed, you have to move the files around and run the premet and spatial file generation
1.  Edit the script file_create_dirs.sh to correspond to the years of data - takes the platform as argument
2.  Execute the script file_move_dir_SSMIS.sh (yyyy and Fxx as arguments) to create a list of mv commands
3.  run the resulting list from the command line
4.  repeat for each year of data
5.  execute premetandspatial.sh with Fxx as argument to generate list for loadbalancer
6.  sbatch run_premet_cetb.sh with Fxx as the argument
7.  run manifest.sh to create the manifest list for OPS
