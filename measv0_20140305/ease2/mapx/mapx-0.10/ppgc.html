<h2> Introduction</h2>
       Satellite remote sensing has made possible the collection of data
over   large areas of the Earth. These data are often stored in "grids."
Grids are  an efficient means of storing data because the location of a value
within   the grid is implicit--it is not explicitly stored in the grid. The
location   is also constant, which makes it easy to compare data from different
sensors    or different time periods.       
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this document is to give a brief introduction to mapping,
gridding, and the associated terminology used in the mapx library at NSIDC.
Along with comments in the source code, it also describes the format of the
map and grid parameter files. </p>
           
<h2> Concepts</h2>

<h3> Maps</h3>
       A map projection is a procedure or mathematical formula to transform 
 a  curved surface onto a plane. The curved surface is usually the surface 
 of  the Earth and the plane is what we call a "map." The derivation of a 
map transformation requires a mathematical representation of the surface of
the Earth. The surface of constant geopotential referred to as mean sea level
or the geoid is quite complicated and its mathematical form is correspondingly 
 complex. When defining map projections then, it is common to approximate 
the surface of the earth with a simpler surface such as an ellipsoid or sphere. 
       
<p>&nbsp;The ellipsoid is flattened at the poles, relative to the sphere,
   by about 1 part in 300. For maps of large areas (continents or bigger)
using   the sphere introduces no significant error. When mapping smaller
areas it   is not uncommon to choose an ellipsoid specifically for each area;
each area  is mapped on an ellipsoid with a different radius and eccentricity.
 </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;Coordinates for points on the surface of the Earth are given in latitude
and longitude. Geodetic latitude is the angle between a vertical ray at the
point and the plane of the equator. Geocentric latitude is the angle between
a ray from the center of the Earth to the point and the plane of the equator.
On a sphere, the geodetic latitude is equivalent to the geocentric latitude.
It's more common to use geodetic latitude. There is only one definition of
longitude--the angle between a ray from the center of the Earth to the point
and the plane of the Greenwich Meridian (an arbitrary reference point). Coordinates
in the map plane (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) are defined in the usual manner with
<i>x</i> horizontal and increasing to the right and <i>y</i> vertical and
increasing upward.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
           
<p><a name="projections"></a> </p>
           
<h3> Projections</h3>
       <img src="mprojex.gif">
             
<p>&nbsp;Map transformations are referred to as projections because they are
commonly visualized as geometric constructs. That is, we think of the map
as a piece of paper wrapped around a globe with lines emanating from points
on the globe and "projected" onto the paper. It's important to note that
not all map projections can be constructed in this manner. </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;Map projections are specified as a set of equations giving <i>x</i> 
   and <i>y</i> in terms of <i>latitude</i> and <i>longitude</i>. The manner 
   in which we wrap the paper around the globe determines the form of the 
equations.  Cylindrical projections wrap the paper around in a tube, conical 
projections  use a cone, and azimuthal projections use a flat surface. Several 
parameters  are used in these equations to specify exactly where the surface 
intersects  the globe, the scale or size of the globe, and the translation 
and rotation  of the map on the plane surface. </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;There is no one best map projection. Each projection has different 
   properties and different "best" uses. Two of the most important characteristics 
   of maps are whether they are conformal or equal-area. No map projection 
 is both, and some are neither. If a map is conformal then angles within a
 small area are reproduced accurately. This means that shapes are preserved. 
 A small circle on the globe will look like a small circle on the map. In 
formal terms, at any point on the map the scale <i>h</i> along a meridian 
of longitude is equal to the scale <i>k</i> along a parallel of latitude. 
If a map is equal-area then a small circle placed anywhere on the map will 
always cover the same amount of area on the globe and the product of <i>h</i> 
and <i>k</i> at any point is one. </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;For maps that are not equal-area, <i>hk</i> - 1 gives a measure
of the areal distortion. For maps that are not conformal, <i>k</i>/<i>h</i>
gives the aspect ratio, which is a measure of shape distortion. For example,
 on the Polar Stereographic map true at 70N (a conformal map) the areal distortion
   varies from -6% at the pole to +29% at 45N and goes up to +276% at the
equator   while, by definition, the aspect ratio remains 1:1 everywhere.
The Azimuthal   Equal-Area map over the pole has, of course, no areal distortion,
while the  aspect ratio varies from 1:1 at the pole to 1.17:1 at 45N and
goes up to 2:1 at the equator. </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;Tissot's indicatrix combines the two previous measures. Tissot's 
   indicatrix is a small ellipse which shows both the scale distortion and 
 the maximum angular deformation at a particular point on the map. See <a
 href="#references">Maling</a> or <a href="#references">Snyder</a> for a
complete discussion. </p>
           
<p><a name="grids"></a> </p>
           
<h3> Grids</h3>
       A grid is a rectangular array of points. Grids record regularly spaced 
  samples over an area. When sampling over the surface of the earth a grid 
 is determined by a map projection, a sampling interval, an origin, and the 
 number of rows and columns. So called "lat/lon" or "equal angle" grids are 
 equivalent to grids sampled on a Cylindrical Equidistant map projection. 
     
<p>  A grid coordinate system is defined in the map plane with axes parallel
   to the rows and columns of the grid and units equal to the sampling interval.
   The grid sample locations are at the whole integer grid coordinate points.
   To conform to mathematical array conventions, the grid coordinates (<i>r</i>,<i>s</i>)
   start at (0,0) in the upper left corner with <i>r</i> increasing to the
 right,  and <i>s</i> increasing downward (this also conforms to digital
image  processing  conventions). A grid cell (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) is defined
as the  area between  grid coordinates <i>i</i>-.5 and <i>i</i>+.5, and <i>j</i>-.5
 and <i>j</i>+.5.  To conform to rounding conventions, the lower bound is
included in the cell  while the upper bound is not (round up at .5).  Note
that the <i>r</i> coordinate  corresponds to the grid column number <i>j</i>,
and the <i>s</i> coordinate  corresponds to the grid row number <i>i</i>.</p>
           
<p>  Think of the grid as a map drawn on graph paper. To find a grid cell
   location, count graph lines over from the left and down from the top,
then    read the latitude and longitude off the map. </p>

<p><a name="binning"></a> </p>
           
<h3> Binning</h3>
       The process of sampling data on a grid is sometimes referred to as 
binning,   especially when the sampling method is to average all data that 
falls into   the grid cell. Other methods used to sample data are: take the 
closest value   to the grid point (nearest neighbor) or interpolate between 
surrounding grid  points.  Also, binning doesn't need to be the average of 
multiple data points;  it could be the minimum, the maximum, the median, or
the latest value in the grid cell. The characteristics of the data should 
determine the sampling method. <br>
      <br>
      <a name="pictures"></a>       
<h3> Pictures</h3>
       Pixels are analogous to grid cells. To display gridded data as a picture, 
   define a transformation from grid coordinates to pixel coordinates and 
then  sample the gridded data at the whole integer pixel coordinate points. 
The  most common technique is to map grid cells onto pixels one for one. More
sophisticated techniques, often referred to as "resampling", allow for scrolling,
zooming, and rotating. <br>
      <br>
      <a name="parameters"></a>       
<h2> Parameters</h2>
       Many programs we use at NSIDC depend on the "mapx" module to handle
 map  projections. These include: GISMO, PSQ, regrid, gridomatic, and the
EASE-Grid  processing software. Most of these tools provide access to predefined
maps,  but, it is relatively easy to define your own map with a map projection 
 parameters  (.mpp) file. <br>
      &nbsp;        
<h3> <a name="mpp"></a>Map Projection Parameters (.mpp) File Format</h3>
       Each parameter is described by a "keyword: value" pair on a single 
line.    A colon must delimit the end of a keyword without any intervening 
spaces,    tabs, or newlines. Keywords are not case sensitive. Parameters 
can be followed    by comments, which begin with a semi-colon (;) or a pound 
sign (#): all  text following a semi-colon or a pound sign on a particular 
line is ignored.  Parameters can appear in any order. The default value is 
used when the corresponding   keyword is not found. Unrecognized keywords 
are silently ignored. This means   that if you misspell a keyword you'll get
the default value without warning.   The following parameters define the
map projection for all projections except   <a href="#isin">Integerized Sinusoidal</a>
and <a href="#utm">Universal Transverse  Mercator (UTM)</a>. <br>

       Keywords must be entered verbatim. Capitalization doesn't matter but 
 white  space does. Unrecognized (or mispelled) keywords are silently ignored. 
 Map  names are not case sensitive, white space and dashes are ignored, and 
 most  word permutations are acceptable. For example, "Equal-Area Cylindrical"
  is  equivalent to "CYLINDRICAL EQUALAREA".       
<p>&nbsp;The reference latitude and longitude specify the original location 
   and orientation of the map projection. The origin of the rectangular map 
  coordinate system can be rotated and translated with the Rotation and Origin 
  keywords. Note that a positive rotation value will rotate the coordinate 
 system <i>counter-clockwise</i> around the translated map origin. This will 
 have the effect of rotating the resulting grid of pixel values <i>clockwise</i> 
  with respect to the grid that would be obtained if the rotation value were 
  0. </p>
           
<p><a name="second_latitude"></a>For the Cylindrical Equal-Area, and Polar 
   Stereographic projections, the second reference latitude specifies the 
latitude  of "true" scale. Conceptually, this is where the projection plane 
intersects   the surface. For the Albers Conic Equal-Area and Lambert Conic 
Conformal  projections, the conic plane is secant to the surface between the
reference  latitude and the second reference latitude. </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;The equatorial radius and eccentricity specify the surface to be
   mapped (usually the Earth's surface). Alternatively, the square of the
eccentricity   rather than the eccentricity may be specified; or both the
equatorial radius   and the polar radius may be specified rather than either
the eccentricity   or the square of the eccentricity; or the polar radius
and either the eccentricity   or the square of the eccentricity map be specified
rather than the equatorial   radius. The scale and the equatorial radius
determine the map units. For  example if the radius is in kilometers (as
is the case with the default) and the scale is 1.0, then the map units will
be kilometers. For spherical projections, the eccentricity should not be
specified, and the default equatorial radius is 6371.228, i.e. the authalic
sphere equivalent to the Clark ellipsoid in km. For elliptical projections,
the default eccentricity is 0.082271673 and the default equatorial radius
is 6378.2064, i.e. the Clark 1866 ellipsoid   in km. For the WGS-84 ellipsoid
in meters, use 0.081819190843 for the eccentricity   and 6378137.0 for the
equatorial radius. PostScript units are inches, so  for PostScript output
you would specify the scale in kilometers per inch.  For a grid you can define
the scale in terms of kilometers per grid cell.  The gridding module "grids"
also has parameters which specify grid cells per map unit or, alternatively,
map units per grid cell. This allows the same .mpp file to be used for multiple
nested grids. </p>
           
<p>Map Origin Latitude and Longitude specify the translated map origin. By
   default the map origin is the same as the reference latitude and longitude. 
   Alternatively, the translated map origin can be specified by Map Origin 
 X and Y, which take precedence over any specification of the Map Origin Latitude
  or Longitude. Both Map Origin X and Y must be specified if either is specified.
  If Map Rotation is specified, then the rotation is centered on the translated
  map origin. Furthermore, the specification of Grid Map Column and Row values
  in the <a href="#gpd">Grid Parameter Definition File</a> will locate the
 translated map origin at the specified column and row location within the
 grid. </p>
           
<p>False easting and false northing offsets are applied to the x and y map
   coordinates, respectively, with respect to the original map origin specified
   by the reference latitude and longitude. Note that Map Origin X and Y
specify    values <i>after</i> false easting and false northing offsets have
been applied.   </p>
           
<p>The center scale value is used only by the Transverse Mercator projection 
   (and for the <a href="#utm">UTM</a> projection as well). It specifies the
   scale factor along the central meridian.<br>
     <br>
     When the maximum error value is non-zero, then error checking, is enabled.
  For a forward transformation (lat-lon to x-y), the computed x-y pair is
inverse  transformed back into a second lat-lon pair. For an inverse transformation 
  (x-y to lat-lon), the computed lat-lon pair is &nbsp;forward transformed 
 into a second x-y pair. In both cases, the distance in map units between 
the first and the second pairs is computed. If it is greater than the maximum 
 error value, then both values of the returned pair (x-y for forward and lat-lon
 for inverse) are set to not-a-number (nan). If the maximum error value is
0 (the default),  then no such error checking is performed. Note that setting
maximum error  to a non-zero value will slow down forward and inverse transformations
 by  about a factor of 2.<br>
      </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;The remaining parameters are used by programs that actually draw 
   maps (e.g. psmap, mapenum). The southern, northern, western, and eastern 
  bounds of the map are the starting point for the graticule and are used 
to  speed up the search in the map outline database. They cannot be counted 
on  to clip the map accurately. All longitudes should be in the range -180 
to  +360. West to east should not span more than 360 degrees. West specifies 
 the left side of the map and east the right, not necessarily the minimum 
and maximum longitudes.  </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;The latitude and longitude graticule intervals specify the spacing 
   between graticule lines. The graticule is the overlay of latitude and longitude
   lines on the map. By default, a parallel is drawn every 30 degrees starting
   at the bottom of the map (90.00S) and a meridian is drawn every 30 degrees
   starting at the left side of the map (180.00W). Label latitude and longitude
   specify the parallel and meridian along which to draw the graticule line
  labels.  </p>
           
<p>&nbsp;The last three numbers are used by the database search routine to
   specify the level of detail for map lines. The level refers to the number 
   and size of features which will be selected, as opposed to resolution of
  each feature. The higher the number, the more detail will be included.
 For   example, level 1 will include only the largest features, such as whole
 continents,   while level 2 would also include some smaller features like
 large lakes.  In either case the continental outline will appear with the
 same amount of  detail (the same jaggedness). <br>

<p>For the ISin projection all map projection parameters have the same definitions
   as described <a href="#mpp">above</a> with the following exceptions. </p>
           
<p>For the ISin projection, the Map Reference Latitude parameter value is
   forced to 0.0; any Map Reference Latitude value supplied by the user is
 ignored.  The Map Reference Longitude parameter is not required for the
ISin  projection;  the default value is 0.0. </p>
           
<p>The Map ISin NZone parameter is used only by the ISin projection; it specifies
   the number of equally spaced latitudinal zones (i.e. "rows"), and must
be   2 or larger and even. Note that this value is a characteristic of the
projection   only and is independent of the actual number of rows in any
grid that utilizes   the ISin projection. Also note that currently only the
default value of 86400  is used by all ECS MODIS products (including all
1000 m, 500 m, and 250 m  products) based on the ISin projection. </p>
           
<p>The Map ISin Justify parameter is used only by the ISin projection; it
   is used to indicate what to do with zones with an odd number of columns. 
  If it has a value of 0 or 1, it indicates the extra column is on the right 
  (zero) or left (one) of the projection y-axis. If the flag is set to 2, 
the  number of columns is calculated so there is always an even number of 
columns  in each zone. Note that currently only the default value of 1 is 
used by all ECS MODIS products based on the ISin projection. </p>
           
<p>By default, setting Map Projection to Integerized Sinusoidal specifies 
   a spherical projection using a radius of 6371007.181 meters. Note that 
this  value is currently used for all ECS MODIS products based on the ISin 
projection.  Only a spherical projection is supported for the ISin projection.

<p>For the UTM projection all map projection parameters have the same definitions 
   as described <a href="#mpp">above</a> with the following exceptions. </p>
           
<p>The UTM zone value is used only by the UTM projection. Zones are in the
   range 1 to 60 for the northern hemisphere, and -1 to -60 for the southern 
   hemisphere. If the UTM zone is 0, then the hemisphere and absolute value 
  of the zone are determined by the reference latitude and longitude, respectively. 
   If the UTM zone is not 0, then the reference latitude and longitude are 
 not required and are ignored if present. The effective reference latitude 
 value for every UTM zone is 0 (the equator); the effective reference longitude 
 value is the central meridian of the zone starting at 177W for zones 1 and 
 -1, 171W for zones 2 and -2, and so on until 177E for zones 60 and -60. Note
  that <i>either</i> Map UTM Zone must be non-zero <i>or both</i> Map Reference
  Latitude <i>and</i> Map Reference Longitude <i>must</i> be specified. </p>
           
<p>The default Map Origin Latitude and Longitude values are determined by
   the effective reference latitude value, which is always 0, and the effective 
   reference longitude value, which is determined from the UTM zone, either 
  as supplied in the Map UTM Zone value or as derived from the Map Reference 
  Longitude value. </p>
           
<p>By default, setting Map Projection to Universal Transverse Mercator specifies
   an ellipsoidal projection using the WGS-84 ellipsoid. To specify a spherical
   UTM projection, set Map Eccentricity to 0, and set Map Equatorial Radius
  to the radius of the sphere in meters. </p>
           
<p>For the UTM projection, the default false easting is 500000 (five hundred 
   thousand) meters. For northern hemisphere UTM zones, the default false 
northing  is 0 meters, and for southern hemisphere UTM zones, the default 
false northing  is 10000000 (10 million) meters. Note that these values assume 
that Map Equatorial  Radius is in meters and that Map Scale is 1.0. Note also
that Map Origin X and Y specify values <i>after</i> false easting and false
northing offsets  have been applied. For example, for the UTM projection for
a southern hemisphere  UTM zone, specifying a Map Origin X value of 175000 
will set the translated  map origin to 325000 (500000 - 175000) meters west 
of the central meridian  for the UTM zone, and specifying a Map Origin Y value
of 5325000 will set  the translated map origin to 4675000 (10000000 - 5325000)
meters south of  the equator. </p>
           
<p>The center scale value specifies the scale factor along the central meridian;
   the default for the UTM projection is 0.9996.<br>
     <br>
     When the maximum error value is non-zero, then error checking, is enabled;
  the default for the UTM projection is 100.0 meters. For a forward transformation 
 (lat-lon to x-y), the computed x-y pair is inverse  transformed back into 
 a second lat-lon pair. For an inverse transformation  (x-y to lat-lon), the
 computed lat-lon pair is &nbsp;forward transformed into a second x-y pair.
 In both cases, the distance in map units between the first and the second
 pairs is computed. If it is greater than the maximum error value, then both
 values of the returned pair (x-y for forward and lat-lon for inverse) are
 set to not-a-number (nan). Note that when error checking is enabled, it
will slow down forward and inverse transformations by  about a factor of
2. To disable error checking, set the maximum error value to 0. Error checking
 is turned on by default for the UTM projection because the equations used
 for the projection can produce errors of more than 100 meters for points 
that are at a latitude of +- 45 degrees and more than&nbsp; about 17.5 degrees 
 of longitude beyond the center of the specified 6 degree-wide UTM Zone;
and in some cases,  forward transformations of a lat-lon pair that is located
far outside of the specified UTM Zone can produce an x-y pair that resides
within the specified  UTM Zone.<br>

<h3> Limitations</h3>
       The mapx library is very flexible but it does impose certain restrictions 
   on the kinds of grids that can be defined. All grids must be rectangular 
  arrays. Rectangular arrays are easy to use with existing scientific visualization 
   tools, like IDL, but they may be inefficient in terms of storage space 
for  non-rectangular data sets. If some flag value (for example zero) is stored
 in the unused cells, then this wasted space can be compacted by any good
data compression scheme. This same invalid data flag can be used within the
grid as well, leading to further storage savings. Another restriction is
that each grid must be based on a map projection defined in mapx. Many of
the most useful projections have already been implemented and fortunately
   it is easy, given a mathematical formulation of the forward and inverse
 transformations,  to add a new projection to mapx (see source code for instructions).
 The mathematical  formulations of most common map projections can be found
 in the references  below.&nbsp;<a name="references"></a>
